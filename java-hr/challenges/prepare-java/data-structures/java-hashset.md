In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, and no repeated values (Wikipedia). $\{1,2,3\}$ is an example of a set, but $\{1,2,2\}$ is not a set. Today you will learn how to use sets in java by solving this problem.

You are given $n$ pairs of strings. Two pairs $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are identical if $a=c$ and $b=d$. That also implies $(a,b)$ is not same as $(b,a)$. After taking each pair as input, you need to print number of unique pairs you currently have.

Complete the code in the editor to solve this problem.

### Input Format

In the first line, there will be an integer $T$ denoting number of pairs. Each of the next $T$ lines will contain two strings separated by a single space.

#### Constraints

- $1 \le T \le 100000$
- Length of each string is at most $5$ and will consist lower case letters only.

### Output Format

Print $T$ lines. In the $i_{th}$ line, print number of unique pairs you have after taking $i_{th}$ pair as input.

### Sample Input
```
5
john tom
john mary
john tom
mary anna
mary anna
```
### Sample Output
```
1
2
2
3
3
```

### Explanation

- After taking the first input, you have only one pair: (john,tom)
- After taking the second input, you have two pairs: (john, tom) and (john, mary)
- After taking the third input, you still have two unique pairs.
- After taking the fourth input, you have three unique pairs: (john,tom), (john, mary) and (mary, anna)
- After taking the fifth input, you still have three unique pairs.
